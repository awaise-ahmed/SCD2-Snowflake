SCD2 implement
https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD

write lambda function
 - fetch data from above api
 - truncate to 2 decimals
 - upload/or replace in s3
 - schedule everyday

snowflake
 - detect using snowpipe
 - copy job everyday
 - use streams/tasks
 - implement scd2
 - consider >2% difference due to volatility

Introduce failures at AWS and snowflake level
Also, schedule the load using Airflow -> Lambda + Snowflake load

 - modify xx_rates_src to include date column
 - create snowpipe to load data from s3 to xx_rates_src
 - xx_rates_stream captures delta changes - append only stream is sufficient
 - xx_rates_tgt change merge statements to read from stream and load differences
